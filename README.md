# scop

first 42Ã©cole graphic/OpenGL project  
All it does is render a obj file with a default texture or with a specified one
  
The code needs a HUGE refactoring

works on MacOS Mojave, only dependency is cmake  
maybe works on linux too, i never tried  
windows sucks, not the primus way

## how to run
```bash
make
```
to install dependencies and compile

```bash
./scop path_to_file.obj [texture_file]
```
to run it
